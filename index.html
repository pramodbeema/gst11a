            <p>Amid the prevailing negativity and controversy surrounding the taxation burden on the middle class, Union Finance Minister Smt. Nirmala Sitharaman has introduced a significant amendment through <em>The Finance Act (No. 2), 2024</em>.</p>
			<p>¬†</p>
			<p><strong>This amendment aims to provide relief to small and micro-scale business owners who do not habitually collect Goods and Services Tax (GST) on their supplies.</p></strong>
            <p>¬†</p>

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, if the Government is satisfied that‚Äî

(a) a practice was, or is, generally prevalent regarding the levy of central tax (including non-levy thereof) on any supply of goods or services or both; and

(b) such supplies were, or are, liable to‚Äî

(i) central tax, in cases where according to the said practice, central tax was not, or is not being, levied, or

(ii) a higher amount of central tax than what was, or is being, levied, in accordance with the said practice,

the Government may, on the recommendation of the Council, by notification in the Official Gazette, direct that the whole of the central tax payable on such supplies, or, as the case may be, the central tax in excess of that payable on such supplies, but for the said practice, shall not be required to be paid in respect of the supplies on which the central tax was not, or is not being, levied, or was, or is being, short-levied, in accordance with the said practice.</div>

        <section class="analysis-section">
            <h3>Understanding the Provision</h3>
            <p>To better understand the impact of Section 11A, let's consider an example of a small panipuri vendor.</p>
			<p>¬†</p>
            <p>Imagine a panipuri vendor who has been running his small stall for years, unaware that he was supposed to collect and pay GST on his sales. Due to the general practice in his locality, most vendors like him do not charge GST, as they believe their business falls outside the tax net. However, without this new provision, tax authorities could later audit his earnings and demand a large sum in back taxes, penalties, and interest. This unexpected liability could cripple his business financially, potentially forcing him to shut down.</p>
			<p>¬†</p>
			<p>With the introduction of Section 11A, the government acknowledges such commonly followed practices and offers relief by waiving the retrospective tax demand. If the government determines that not collecting GST was a prevalent practice in his industry and region, it can issue a notification to exempt him from paying the back taxes. This provision provides much-needed protection and assurance, allowing small business owners to continue their operations without the fear of sudden financial liabilities.</p>
			<p>¬†</p>
			<p>In essence, the absence of this section could place a heavy burden on small vendors due to their lack of awareness and formal financial knowledge. On the other hand, its presence provides legal protection and flexibility, encouraging compliance without undue hardship.</p>

            <h3>Addressing Misinformation</h3>
            <p>Recently, a doctored GST notice has been circulating online, falsely claiming that a panipuri vendor received a GST notice for exceeding ‚Çπ40 lakh in his bank account. Despite being debunked as fake news, the misinformation spread rapidly, overshadowing the fact-checking efforts.</p>
            <p>However, even if we assume that such a notice was genuinely issued, the affected vendor could potentially seek relief under Section 11A. This provision enables small-scale businesses that followed common practices of non-levy or under-levy of GST to avoid retrospective tax liabilities.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="analysis-section">
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The introduction of Section 11A offers much-needed relief to small and micro business owners who may not have been aware of their GST obligations due to common business practices. It underscores the government's commitment to protecting small entrepreneurs from undue financial burdens while maintaining tax compliance in a fair and transparent manner.</p>
